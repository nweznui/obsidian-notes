[[Karl Marx]]'s published series of analysis of [[political economy]].
When writing the volumes of Capital, he sought to verify his analysis of political economy as meticulously as possible through historical exposition. 
In his bibliography were thousands of citations, common today in scholarly research but unprecedented for his time. (There was no internet in the 19th century! These were all real books.)
Marx wrote capital because he saw present political economy as dominated by the ideology of the bourgeois, and explained through the lens of those who materially benefit from capitalism. He sought to define a perspective that considers the working class.
