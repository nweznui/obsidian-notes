# a. Productive and unproductive labor during the period of formal domination

What are we looking at in this chapter? Productive, and unproductive labor.
But also, the appearances of these two under the different periods of domination under the CMP: formal domination and real domination.

Lets look at the essentials formulated by Marx.

	You are not a productive laborer if you simply produce a wage.
	
You *are* a productive worker if your labor (surplus labor from your total labor-time) *objectifies itself*, as a fluid *quantum of value*. (surplus-value)
In simple terms: if you produce surplus labor that can be transformed into surplus value.
You must permit M-C-M' to take place.
Your work must be consumed *for its use-value* (as transferable into commodities).

Typically, unproductive labor is a service. (Though not always, as commodities can take the form of services depending on the social relation).

Unproductive labor's work is consumed as *creating exchange-value*. This doesn't mean necessarily valorization (which happens in the immediate process of production) but the *realization of exchange value*.

Distinction: 
- Is the work exchanged for *money as money?* - Unproductive labor.
- Is the work exchanged for *money as capital?* - Productive labor.

In real domination, everything that once existed for man now exists for capital.
Two new essential characteristics now emerge from this consideration:
1. Productive labor is labor immediately exchanged with capital. Labor transforms money into capital.
2. Labor realizes itself in the commodities of productive labor.

These analyses have only been in the context of *productive capital*, but what about *merchant's capital?*
What becomes of labor under capital's self autonomization, when it frees itself of use-value, in the form of *merchant's capital*?
By analyzing capitalism's general tendency when face-to-face with the proletariat.
# b. Net and gross product.

A relative, or absolute fall in the number of proletarians (e.g. the major labor sector in the USA being the service industry) does not constitute a negation of Marxism. 

Because this is what **capitalist production strives for:**
1. The greatest possible production of surplus value or net revenue.
2. The greatest possible reduction in the **proportional** relation of proletarians, or those living on surplus value, for the greatest number of commodities produced by them. This labor force being *only* as large as possible as so to achieve the *level of productivity required* for this surplus to grow.

The productive power of the laborer is hostile to himself as he works to later be displaced by constant capital. 
There will always be a reserve army of labor to be thrown on the street, and one that is extracted for their wage-slavery, only to be later thrown back out. The capitalist is always seeking to eliminate the proletarian from the production process.
In-between these classes is the middle class that reinforces the relationship between the capitalist and proletarian, the *middle class itself being maintained by net revenue produced by the capitalist*.

What are the middle classes and how do they consume surplus-value?
Misconception-- capitalist society would have aimed for their disappearance.

	a) Why does the capitalist disappear from bourgeois society?
One example: the money capitalist has managers, that, though they do not own the money-capital they manage, is employed to care of all of the real functions that normally the capitalist, or proprietor of the money-capital, would perform.

There becomes a demand for people who do not directly possess capital but hold the rights to carry out exploitation via *social capital*. Continuously they improve the management of production to appropriate *their* section of surplus-value, or net revenue. Technocrats (e.g. programmers at Uber) in the present day are an example of this.

	b) Which middle classes, if not as a whole, *are* disappearing?
We must analyze *the first movement M-C (v)* in the context of M-C-M'.
