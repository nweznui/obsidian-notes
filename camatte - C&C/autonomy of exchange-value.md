Exchange-value is autonomous in the movement [[C-M-C]].

Note that C-M-C is contextualized during the lower phase of capitalism, [[mercantile exchange]]. This is important to consider for it's analysis.

The value of money is determined in relation to C-M-C's circulation continuously.

The autonomization of exchange-value is the result of the circulation process.
By studying it we find:
1. Exchange-value exists as commodity, and as money. In the commodity money exists as a price, in money it exists in a self-representative, variable form.
2. Money must be able to be both a result of the circulation process, and it must be able to re-enter it. It cannot be a finite (?) substance that disappears into the commodity never to be seen again after it's exchange, it must re-appear.

Exchange-value is autonomous as part of a process, not as a vanishing form of use value. 

Exchange-value is indifferent to material content.

Circulation becomes **exchange-value itself**, during the process, exchange value measured in money.

Circulation appears as a movement of the production of exchange values.

During money-accumulation, when circulation is suspended, exchange-value is valorized.

Circulation must have a productive phase where valorization takes place.

To prevent the loss of exchange value during the commodity's consumption, the exchange value of the commodity **is consumed for it's use-value first and foremost.** The exchange value **arises anew** from the consumption into the transformation of a new commodity, with a new use-value. This is [[productive consumption]].

Exchange-value must be able to leave and re-enter the process of circulation. It must be able to **preserve itself within it,** to be active in this way it becomes autonomous.
