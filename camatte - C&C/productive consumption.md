	The production and re-production of exchange-value, consumption through labor.
(Marx, Urtext p. 932-3)

	Labour uses up its material factors, its subject and its instruments, consumes them, and is therefore a process of consumption. Such productive consumption is distinguished from individual consumption by this, that the latter uses up products, as means of subsistence for the living individual; the former, as means whereby alone, labour, the labour-power of the living individual, is enabled to act. The product, therefore, of individual consumption, is the consumer himself; the result of productive consumption, is a product distinct from the consumer.

Consumption during the act of production. 
We need wood to make a chair. Wood is a [[commodity]] we may buy from a lumber-cutting facility. In order to produce a chair, a commodity we product then intend to later sell, we must consume wood, a commodity we had to exchange for money in order to be able to create our chair.
