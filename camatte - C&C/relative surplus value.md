Preceded by [[absolute surplus value]].
Revolutionizes the technological processes of labor and groupings of society.

	It was a question of knowing how surplus-value appeared in the period of the 
	real subsumptlon of labour under capital. Marx gave three cases. 

*How does relative surplus-value appear under real subsumption?*

==**Case one:**==
	Variation in the [[mode of production]] due to [[labor productivity]], arising with the domination of capital.

The productivity of the workers, and relation between workers and capitalists, is where [[formal domination]] is epitomized and relative surplus value makes its appearance during the [[real subsumption of labor under capital]]. 

	The first: variation of production due to labour productivity; this 
	is the one arising with real domination of capital, the other two 
	"operating" especially within formal domination.

==**Case two:**==
During the realization of the [[immanent tendency of capital]], after real-subsumption.
