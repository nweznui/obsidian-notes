How much [[value]] a [[commodity]] has is determined by it's [[socially necessary labor time]].

	the magnitude of value 
	depends on the "socially 
	necessary labor time" of 
	a commodity.
(Heinrich, Introduction to Capital p. 44)

Through [[circulation]], or exchange between consumers of commodities and producers, 
commodities are brought together, compared, and become equivalents:
	*1 coat = 12 yards of linen*

If a [[capitalist]] produces too little, they put more than what is seen as a socially necessary amount of labor into a product, and reduce the potential amount of [[exchange-value]] he may extract as a result.

	"This becomes manifest, on the one hand, as a law, since the capitalist who 
	produces on too small a scale puts more than the socially necessary quantum 
	of labour into his products." 
(Marx, Results p. 1038)
