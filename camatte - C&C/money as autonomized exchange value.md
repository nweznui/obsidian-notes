Money is a simple quantitative movement only capable of increasing itself, during the [[mercantile exchange]] phase of capitalism. It can only be accumulated.

Money represents the coalescence of all use-values and is the materialization of labor-time. This materialization faces a quantitative barrier that opposes capital's goal of continuous, infinite self-autonomization. An instance of this materialization is the [[gold standard]].

Money is only capable of an abstract existence for as long as it **preserves itself against use-value,** it's opposite. 

*What does this mean? A process:*
1. Though money is expended when we buy commodities, such as when we buy a toy or a pound of sugar, it is exchanged for the use-value of the thing we desire.
2. Money maintains itself through the universal (pricing) of the toy and on our person as a measurable finite resource. It must have a *universal* use-value...
3. It cannot become *individual* use value because it must be capable of a universal application.
4. It must do this, but also *grow as exchange value* when it is used to *consume something with use-value.*
5. The *act of consumption of use-value* must transform into *production and re-production of exchange value itself.*

The intercourse between money and [[productive consumption]] has been made. Now we may analyze the result: [[capital concieved from money]].
