Though we may want to measure money by the gold standard, there is only a finite amount of gold in the world, and a finite amount we could reasonably account for and keep the accumulation of. The relentless accumulation of gold is in contradiction with it's quality.

Money, beginning as abstract concept, but represented through the real use-value of gold, is **reified**, made real, and is collected for it's own use-value. In other words, gold as a representation of money becomes obsolete.
