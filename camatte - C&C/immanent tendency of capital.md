The immanent tendency of capital, or "production for production's sake" comes with [[formal subsumption]].
Produce as much and as many surplus as much as possible without consequence.
Only becomes adequately realized until the [[real subsumption of labor under capital]].
One of the cases of appearance of [[relative surplus value]].

	Marx analysed next the connection between the two moments, later studied in 
	depth in Parts Four and Five
	of Volume I, as we have mentioned. He pointed out the immanent tendency of 
	capital:
	
	“‘Production for production’s sake’ - production as an end in itself - does 
	indeed come onto
	the scene with the formal subsumption of labour under capital. It makes its 
	appearance as
	soon as the immediate purpose of production is to produce as much and as 
	many 
	surplus-
	value as possible, as soon as the exchange-value of the product becomes the 
	deciding factor.
	But this inherent tendency of the capital relation does not become 
	adequately 
	realized - it
	does not become indispensable, and that also means technologically 
	indispensable - until the
	specific capitalist mode of production and hence the real subsumption of 
	labour under capital
	has developed.” (ibid. p. 1037)
