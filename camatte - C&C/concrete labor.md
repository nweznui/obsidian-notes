"This generally-accepted definition can be reduced to the following, very simple statement: concrete labor is the expenditure of human energy in a determined form (clothesmaking, weaving, etc.)."
[^2.]: Heinrich, Introduction, pg. 48. "Qualitatively different “concrete labors” produce qualitatively different use values: carpentry produces a chair; linen weaving produces a linen sheet. When we “learn a trade,” we study the particularities of a concrete activity; when we observe a person working, then we observe him or her executing a concrete act of labor."
