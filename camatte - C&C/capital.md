> By capital we understand (provisionally; we'll get more precise later) a particular sum of value, the goal of which is to be “valorized,” which is to say, generate a surplus.
heinrich, introduction to capital, pg 16.

*interest-bearing capital:*
money is lent at interest and this interest is the surplus.

*merchant capital:*
products are produced cheaply in one place and sold dearly in another place or another point in time. think petit-bourgeois artists who buy acrylic keychains manufactured overseas with cheap labor to sell it at a surplus at art booths. or people who buy merchandise with the intention of selling it at an upmarked price at a future point in time when they are more sought after and scarce.

*industrial capital*:
capital is advance for the purchase of means of production and employment of forces of labor. products are sold. revenue is used for means of production and wages, capital must reproduce itself and yield a surplus.
