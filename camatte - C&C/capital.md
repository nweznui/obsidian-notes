An accumulation of money, or a coalesced, concatenated sum of value. Its goal is to be valorized and generate [[surplus value]]. [^1]

Capital becomes distinct from [[money]] from the difference in their form of circulation. Capital is money necessary to buy something in order to sell it again (described in [[M-C-M]]).[^2]

**Capital only exists *within* the process of buying and selling.** 
It is wealth that *grows* through the process of circulation, or exchange.
