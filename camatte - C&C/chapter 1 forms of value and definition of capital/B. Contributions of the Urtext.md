The secret of production is the exploitation of the proletariat.
Capital is a social relation whose valorization masks itself as an innate quality, instead of presenting the true source of surplus value-- labor-power.
Capital seeks to maintain it's existence through the [[autonomy of exchange-value]].

Through [[circulation]], or exchange between consumers of commodities and producers, 
commodities are brought together, compared, and become equivalents:
	*1 coat = 12 yards of linen*
This is known as the [[law of value]].

"[[objectified universal labor-time]]", is a universal equivalent for the exchange of commodities.
	 *1 coat = 12 units of (socially necessary) labor-time*
	*1 coat* = *$500*
	 *$500* = *12 units of (socially necessary) labor-time*
This could also be understood as [[money]].

Money must be represented by a material object with a universal use-value (in this case gold, which is socially determined as universally useful) in [[mercantile exchange]].

Because money represents *objectified universal labor-time*, it must have a variable value.
This is because labor-time itself is [[variable capital]], and does not produce value consistently spread through commodities. Hence, the [[gold standard]].
