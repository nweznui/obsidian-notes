Here [[Jacques Camatte|Camatte]] aims to determine how capital is created. 
The following should be resolved:
1. The analysis of the commodity is insufficient to explain money's transformation into capital.
2. In studying circulation of exchange value, there is a productive phase that occurs in order for exchange-value to gain autonomy where use-value is consumed ([[productive consumption]]). How does this engender exchange value?

We will conclude these two points.

Two distinctions are to be established (from what? in what?)
1. The [[labor process]], the confrontation of man with the means of production
2. The [[valorization process]], the conservation of value and the creation of an increase of value.
The [[production process]] is the unity of these two, it's [[immediate process]] is as follows:

`v + c` represents the labor process. 

Valorization occurs in :
1. conservation of value, advanced by the [[means of production]].

2. value creation.

In the conservation of value, v must be restored before the production of s. 
But this takes lesser importance, as it is *masked* by value creation.

Societies in which value did not exist, or is abolished, could be labeled [[camatte - C&C/communism|communist]].

The [[production process]] is the unity of the labor process and valorization, and its result, the [[commodity]], is the immediate *unity of use-value and exchange value*.

Use value corresponds to [[concrete labor]]. Exchange-value corresponds to [[abstract labor]].
Inside the labor process we must distinguish between [[dead labor]] and [[living labor]].

The production process could be described as a traffic between living and objectified labor.(double check)

[[labor capacity]] is separate from [[labor-power]].

Values are realized in [[circulation]] but produced in a different sphere.

Commodities produced by a capitalist are not produced for use value but [[surplus value]]. This differentiates the capitalist from the money-owner. (does it... double check)

There is a difference between circulation in the period of commodity production, and that of the capitalist period, determined by an exchange of "non-equivalent entities" (I still don't know the delineation between these two periods.)

Marx's work should be looked upon as a unity, where one fragment explains another. Concepts cannot be considered in isolation.

In [[capital]], specific social relations of production between people appear as "natural social properties of things."

Man does not dominate but the object.
The means of subsistence buy the worker and incorporate him into the means of production.

The analysis of superstructures involves investigating the forms of property linked with alienated labor.
