What we would refer to today under the umbrella of "economics". 
*Political economy* originally referred to a branch of ethics, that did not delineate between politics and economics as fields of study. However, after the growth of Positivism in the 19th century, "economics" was denoted as a branch of science instead. Adam Smith is seen as the "grandfather" of this modern, liberal science.

[[Karl Marx]] did not "invent" political economy. He did recognize it in it's state of being dominated by the ideology of the bourgeois, and explained through the lens of those who materially benefit from capitalism. He sought to define a perspective that considers the working class.

When writing [[Das Kapital]], he sought to verify his analysis of political economy as meticulously as possible through historical exposition.
