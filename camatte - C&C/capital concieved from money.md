What is the result of the conception between [[money]] and [[productive consumption]]?
[[capital]].
How is capital characterized from this conception?
1. Money aspires to be imperishable, capital attains this by *abandoning itself to circulation.* (what does this mean... maybe we will find out later :))
2. Capital may be metamorphosed into any commodity.  It simultaneously holds and is value.
3. No longer is it lost in circulation, between a money-form and commodity form, in the movement [[C-M-C]]. [[Exchange-value]], in capital, is first and foremost *itself*. But it may be converted back to money or commodity to further valorize itself.

Only through the *exchange of money with labor* may money's transformation into capital may take place. (See [[labor-power]])
