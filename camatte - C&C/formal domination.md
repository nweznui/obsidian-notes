[[Capitalism]] is distinguished from other [[mode of production]]s because it is not based only in appropriation of [[surplus value]] but on the creation of surplus value.

The productivity of the workers, and relation between workers and capitalists, is where formal domination is epitomized and [[relative surplus value]] makes its appearance during the [[real subsumption of labor under capital]]. 

	It was a question of knowing how surplus-value appeared in the period of the 
	real subsumptlon of labour under capital. Marx gave three cases. 
	
	The first: variation of production due to labour productivity; this 
	is the one arising with real domination of capital, the other two 
	"operating" especially within formal domination.
