Hordes of pseuds like to proselytize the importance of "dialectical" reasoning. Often invoked as an argument-ender. Is really a thinly veiled ad-hominem that the argumenter presents as philosophical complexity.

There are many myths surrounding dialectics, one being:
The *Thesis - Antithesis - Synthesis* triad. The most popular conception of dialectics outside of scholarship. You are supposed to begin with a position *thesis*, find it's opposite *antithesis*, then the *synthesis* of both, an apparently "truer" concept of harmony.
Does not make sense, and doesn't have universal applicability. Falls into liberal centralist idealist answers. Supposed to resemble Being-Nothing-Becoming, but:
    a. Becoming isn't a synthesis of being and nothing. It is both Being and Nothing but also is more than the two concepts as a *subulation.*
    b. *Subulations* preserve the contradiction or antithetical terms and then become new terms.

Trotsky's *ABC of Materialist Dialectics* presents it's own problems.
But his first criticism of formal logic, that A=A is an ideal abstraction, and in reality things are always changing, is a weak one.
An apple is still an apple even if it shed some atoms on it's way to your house.
Abstractions with general ideas work fine in practicality.

For Trotsky, dialectics is the acknowledgement that material reality is always becoming something else. But he fails to provide a concrete argument for this through his failed critique of formal logic which he could also be accused of regressing into.
The value he presents is the importance of historical context to understand anything.

Philosophy/dialectical philosophy was not Engels' strength. Marx did not speak of a "law of dialectics" nor did Hegel who denies in his most famous work that formulating his method was a possibility.

Engels believed dialectics, by law, transforms quantity into quality. He makes a universalization of Hegel's quantity-quality measure. But it doesn't have a lot of use for thinking.
The *law of unity and conflict of opposites* arises as an understanding *through* dialectics but is not dialectics itself.

> So far one can see that _dialectics_ just seems to be an ensemble of synthesized propositions basically restating something that is a very basic set of two philosophical axioms and good empirical observation_: everything changes all the time, and there is an inescapable relation of causality between everything at some level, the level of material existence and activity being the final explanation as to why anything is the way it is.

Understanding dialectics is imperative to keep the project of communism alive.

Diamat in USSR: state doctrinal religion, all aspects of thinking are either proletarian science
or bourgeois science and the Soviet world reaped Lysenkoism.

The "world marxist" understanding of dialectics replaces a great science with religion. Dialectic is not a formula or set of laws. It is **sustained analytic dialogue within a subject.** The relentless analysis and critique of concepts.
